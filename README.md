  we're collectively autistic and haven't really had any public socials/interacted with people in a few years so genuinely sorry if anything we say comes across wrong - unless you're being a dick we won't be one back

  usually whatever skin we're in is whoever's currently fronting, but that's not always the case. feel free to ask if you're unsure
  </p>
  <p align="center">
 please don't try to roleplay with us (jokingly is funny) or treat us like our sources bro it's weird
</p>
<p align="center">
we're drinking most of the time, feel free to hide/block us if this irritates you/makes you uncomfortable
